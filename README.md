# Embedded Processor Design Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the design, simulation, and implementation of a custom embedded processor tailored for arithmetic and logic-heavy domain-specific applications.

The processor is based on the architectural specification given in the CSA lectures Processor Design exercise and is implemented through a staged methodology. 

1. Functional ISA Simulation
2. Microarchitectural Modeling
3. RTL (Hardware) Implementation
4. Performance Analysis & Bottleneck Discovery

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on understanding of: 
* Instruction Set Design
* Datapath Design
* Control Logic
* Prefetch Mechanism
* Memory Interaction
* Architecture Bottlenecks
